    Intro

  <p>
    Hey there, I'm Skye Selbiger. I'm a Portland, OR native and Product Designer currently at Cozy.

  <p>
    At Cozy I've primarily worked on our payments products, and our design system and style guide. Most recently, I've been leading design on our new listings features: communication and discovery.

    Previous to Cozy, I lived in Echo Park of Los Angeles, CA and worked at Noun Project & Lingo.

    At Noun Project, I mainly focused on our creators experience. This included how creators uploaded content to the platform, guides/documentation, and the creator dashboard. For Lingo, I mainly worked on our native mac app, sign up experience, oboarding, and monetization.

   Outside of my day-to-day work, I also co-own a small batch bakery called Wyld Bread with my fiancé Cortney. Wyld Bread specializes in naturally leavened breads and whole grain pastries. Were at one farmers market right now and do classes from our home.
    Cortney runs the business full-time, making all the delicious bread and baked goods you see. While I focus on branding, and exploring new ways to grow our business.

    I also roast coffee in the extra bit of spare time I have with a Behmor 1600 Plus
    (it looks like a toaster oven). Can I get more Portland?

    We also have a wonderful small (big!) pit/boxer/lab named River. I love to talk about him because he's also a huge part of our lives. He adventures with us most places like Banff, Glacier, Hood, and everywhere else we go.
